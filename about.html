<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I like to travel, I like to get to know new places, I enjoy the traditions 
    of the places mainly Mexico, I love the typical food of the region and 
    I enjoy the company of my family</p>

<p>I like sports, mainly practicing them, I don't like to watch them on television, 
    now with my son I enjoy his company and teach him about all kinds of exercise 
    or sport, it's his time to enjoy extreme sports a lot, but now I go at the 
    pace that my son demands of me</p>    

<p>I enjoy every moment of my life, mainly a good conversation, it has come the stage
     in my life of needing the company of my parents and my wife, 
     so what I wish most is to be able to spend the night watching movies with 
     my wife or enjoying a drink in a bohemian place</p>
